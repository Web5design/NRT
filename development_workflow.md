# Development workflow

## Tabs (nope)
No tabs please, 2 spaces in all languages (HTML, CSS, Coffeescript...)

## Commit workflow 
Work on feature branches, commit often with small commits with only one change
to the code. When you're ready to merge your code into the master branch,
submit a pull request and have someone else review it.

## Commenting your code
Writing small (<10 lines), well named functions is preferable to comments, but
obviously comment when your code isn't intuitive.

## Documentation
New developers will expected to be able to get the application up and running
on their development machines purely by reading the README. Doing anything in
the app workflow which isn't intuitive? Make sure it's in here.
