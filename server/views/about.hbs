    <h2>A proof-of-concept application</h2>

    <p>
      UNEP-WCMC, in partnership with AGEDI and EAD, are developing NRT, a
      system that helps countries report and manage environmental
      knowledge. This consists of two elements: the environmental
      information itself, in the form of indicators; and a contextual
      narrative that explains the trends and implications of these
      indicators to the audience of decision-makers. As a flexible system
      it supports the compilation of any type of report, from the short,
      single issue indicator report through to larger, cross-sectoral
      State of Environment Report.

  <h2>We need your feedback</h2>

    <p>
      We are developing this toolkit through an iterative method,
      presenting several releases at roughly 6 week intervals to ensure
      that what is delivered in December as the final release is most
      aligned with the needs of you, the user. You are about to view
      Release 2, which contains most of the functionality you would
      expect in the final release.
    </p>

  <div class="column right">
    <p>
      This is why we need your feedback. We want to make sure the toolkit
      is as useful as possible for you, so if you have any questions or
      feedback, please email. Our developer team will take your comments
      on board and begin modifying NRT as soon as this session is
      complete.
