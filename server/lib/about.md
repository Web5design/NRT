# Welcome to the National Reporting Toolkit

Welcome to the National Reporting Toolkit (NRT).

## NRT is a proof-of-concept application

UNEP-WCMC, in partnership with AGEDI and EAD, are developing NRT, a system that helps countries report and manage environmental knowledge. This consists of two elements: the environmental information itself, in the form of indicators; and a contextual narrative that explains the trends and implications of these indicators to the audience of decision-makers. As a flexible system it supports the compilation of any type of report, from the short, single issue indicator report through to larger, cross-sectoral State of Environment Report. hrough online collaborative report writing, pre-loaded templates and data visualisation,  the often lengthy process of writing, styling and proofing a report is significantly diminished, allowing more accurate and current information to be delivered faster to decision-makers and reducing delays due to reporting lag.

NRT is currently under development. This phase of development (2013) should prove that using NRT can ensure _the most recent data_ is reported and that _it takes lesss time_ to write a report. The next phases will roll the software out to a number of different countries. 

## We need your feedback 

We are developing this toolkit through an iterative method, presenting several releases at roughly 6 week intervals to ensure that what is delivered in December as the final release is most aligned with the needs of you, the user. You are about to view Release 1, which contains most of the functionality you would expect in the final release. There are still a few bugs to fix and a few extra features we want to tweak, but the **basic functionality** should be here. 

This is why **we need your feedback**. We still have a long way to go to December and we want to make sure this is as useful as possible for you. If you have any questions or feedback, please [email](mailto://eadstaff%2Bk2kokbgwnljldhc3dk9k@boards.trello.com). 

Our developer team will take your comments on board and begin modifying NRT as soon as this session is complete. 

To start you could:

- review the [reports](/reports) in the system

- or check recent updates to reports and indicators in the [dashboard](/dashboard)


## What benefits will NRT generate?

With a more accurate and comprehensive flow of data, informed decision-making can occur: environmental information is the currency required by planners to deliver an environmentally sound development agenda . Outputs from NRT can be used to provide the evidence base for new plans, as well as providing a platform to monitor and demonstrate the success of implementation through indicator reports. As such NRT can catalyse global efforts to reduce environmental impact and deliver real gains to the wellbeing of human populations without compromising the ecological base we all depend on.  In this way NRT can provide useful tools to enable the transition to a Green Economy based on environmentally responsible economic development, paving the way to “the future we want”.
