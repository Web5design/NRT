      {"title": "Description", "content": "The ecosystems, habitats and communities of flora and fauna of Tanzania are a fragile, priceless treasure. However, development and growth impose intense pressure on these natural assets. Consequently, there is an urgent need for planned and wide-ranging approaches to ecological management and conservation. In protecting the natural assets of the Emirate, EAD has adopted a variety of measures, requiring effective policies, regulations and actions. These include signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with partners to maintain the delicate balance between development and the environment. EAD is also implementing international commitments and treaties for biodiversity conservation. For example, in February 2000 the UAE ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The CBD aims to establish a global network of comprehensive, representative and effectively-managed protected areas, conserving at least ten per cent of each of the world's ecological regions. Tanzania supports this crucial target through its conservation policies, spearheaded by EAD."}
